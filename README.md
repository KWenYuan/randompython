# randompython
This is a place where I code python for fun.

## rockpaperscissors.py 
You would need 10 points to win the whole game.
We will only need to use the 'random' module, thus 'import random'
The program will choose randomly a number 1 to 3. With 'Scissors', 'Paper' and 'Stone' assigned to each respectively.

## zigzagstars.py
It prints out a zigzag pattern of stars in an interval of 0.5 seconds.
Uses the 'time' module

## numberguess.py
This is the normal number guess but with more user choice, such as letting the user input lower and upper limit, number of tries before losing.
Uses the 'random' module.
