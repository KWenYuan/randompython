# randompython
This is a place where I code python for fun.

## Firstly done would be an easy version of rock paper scissors against the computer. Where you would need 10 points to win the whole game.
We will only need to use the 'random' module, thus 'import random'
The program will choose randomly a number 1 to 3. With 'Scissors', 'Paper' and 'Stone' assigned to each respectively.

## Second would be the zigzag stars.
It prints out a zigzag pattern of stars in an interval of 0.5 seconds.
